# Kaaj – A Hyperlocal Job & Service Marketplace

## 🌟 About Kaaj
Kaaj is a hyperlocal platform designed for Indian users, especially Bengali, Hindi, and English speakers. It connects recruiters (households, shop owners, small businesses) with skilled job seekers for both long-term roles and quick, one-time gigs. The platform aims to bring structure, trust, and visibility to the informal job sector using real-time technology and regional accessibility.
